# personal_projects

Space for my tiny projects.

- `data_structure`: Tried to implement essential data structures by myself.
- `pw_generator`: Password generator.
- `rotate_cube`: Draw rotating donut in the shell
  - `my_donut.cpp` is the reimplemented version of `donut.c` from [donut-math.html](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html). The original one in C language is also placed here (with some minor modification).
  - Rotating **cube** itself is a bit more hard, but I'm eager to give it a try.
- `simple_calculator`: Arithmetic calculator using [recursive descent parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser).
  - Invalid expression may cause an error at this point.
  - C++23 is required.
- `sort_algorithm`: Implemented some type of sort algorithms.
- `tools_for_Notion`: Python script to use Notion API.
  - `kindle_highlights`: Extract highlighted parts in Kindle books and make summary page in Notion database.
  - `paper_retriever`: Get paper information with DOI and make summary page in Notion database.
